The Founder Dashboard Structure

This is the UI skeleton that every regional founder sees.It defines:

the tabs

the metrics

the permissions

the tools

the escalation paths

the payout visibility

the dispute workflow

the escrow ledger view

This is not design.This is architecture — the operational blueprint your devs will implement.

Here it is, clean and ready for your repo.
