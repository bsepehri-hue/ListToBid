# Discovery Note

This file is not code. It is the founder’s charter — a ceremonial scroll that records
the vision of ListToBid before launch. It exists outside the mechanics to ensure that
the heartbeat of the underdog economy, the sealed canons, and the cultural identity
of the marketplace remain intact even if the code changes or the founder is absent.
Anyone who discovers this file should treat it as the guiding compass of the system:
a manifesto of trust, loyalty, and resilience.
