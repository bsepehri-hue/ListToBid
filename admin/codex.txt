🧭 Codex Principles
- Clarity: Every scroll is written in plain commerce tone.  
- Inclusivity: Merchants, stewards, and customers all have defined roles.  
- Autonomy: Storefronts and auctions operate independently but within codex law.  
- Resilience: Rituals and ceremonies preserve emotional resonance for future stewards.

🧬 Legacy Clause
- The Codex Scroll is the living charter of ListToBid.  
- Future stewards inherit not just technical clarity, but ceremonial unity.  
- The Underdog Economy Manifesto is embedded across all scrolls, sealed in codex law.
