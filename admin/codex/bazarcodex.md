✅ Bazar Codex
This is the scroll that defines the marketplace itself — the architecture, the rules, the physics, the emotional tone, the spatial logic, and the living structure of the Bazar.

Everything else we’ve built sits inside this world.  
This codex defines the world itself.

Here it is — clean, elegant, and fully Codex‑ready.

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the architecture and logic of the Bazar — the living marketplace where:

- listings appear  
- storefronts live  
- auctions unfold  
- buyers explore  
- stewards influence  
- cycles begin  

The Bazar is not a grid of products.  
It is a living commercial ecosystem.

The Bazar must feel:

- alive  
- vibrant  
- trustworthy
