🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the identity, structure, and operational rules of storefronts (“Bazar Shops”) inside ListToBid.

The Bazar Codex ensures:

- consistent storefront identity  
- lineage‑anchored activity  
- transparent performance  
- fair economic rules  
- healthy marketplace behavior  

A storefront is not just a page — it is a living chamber inside the marketplace tier.

🧿 2. Storefront Identity (BZR‑XID)

Every storefront receives a unique BazarXID:

`
BZR‑<XID>
`

This identity links to:

- MerchantXID  
- ListingXIDs  
- Storefront Health Codex  
- Earnings Lineage  
- Trust Ledger  
- Cycle Chain  

The storefront becomes a lineage anchor for all merchant activity.

🪶 9. Stewardship Notes

- Storefronts must feel personal, not corporate.  
- Identity should reflect craft, not scale.  
- Health must be transparent and fair.  
- Lineage must be immutable.  
- The Bazar is the heart of the marketplace.
