🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the short, ceremonial statements that appear at:

- the portal entrance  
- onboarding transitions  
- path selections  
- storefront creation  
- auction entry  
- steward activation  
- lineage milestones  

Entry statements are the threshold markers of the Codex.

They set tone, expectation, and emotional gravity.

🪶 8. Stewardship Notes

- Entry statements must be short, poetic, and ceremonial.  
- They must feel like thresholds, not notifications.  
- They must reinforce identity, lineage, and belonging.  
- They must be consistent across the entire platform.
