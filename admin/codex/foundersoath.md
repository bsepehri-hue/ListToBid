Intention • Integrity • Stewardship

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the foundational vow of the creator of ListToBid — the oath that anchors:

- the marketplace  
- the economy  
- the stewardship system  
- the Codex  
- the legacy  

This oath is not a mission statement.  
It is a promise, a binding intention, a north star.

🔥 2. The Oath Principle

The Founder’s Oath must:

- protect the underdog  
- honor the steward  
- empower the merchant  
- elevate the buyer  
- preserve the lineage  
- sustain the economy  
- uphold the truth  

It is the ethical spine of the entire system.

📜 3. The Founder’s Oath (Ceremonial Text)

`
I build this marketplace as a sanctuary for the underdog,
a world where fairness is not a feature but a foundation.

I vow to protect the integrity of every cycle,
to honor the lineage of every sale,
to preserve the truth of every offering.

I vow to empower stewards with continuity,
to reward influence with legacy,
to ensure that no contribution is forgotten.

I vow to uphold transparency in every fee,
stability in every treasury,
and clarity in every ritual.

I vow to build systems that heal what was broken,
restore what was lost,
and elevate those who were overlooked.

I vow to lead with empathy,
to architect with intention,
and to steward this marketplace with unwavering integrity.

This is my oath.
This is my lineage.
This is my legacy.

🪶 5. Stewardship Notes

- The oath is not decorative — it is operational.  
- It informs every Codex decision.  
- It protects the marketplace from corruption.  
- It ensures the system remains human‑centered.  
- It binds the founder to the same standards as the stewards.  

The Founder’s Oath is the moral root of ListToBid.
