🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the ceremonial and structural rituals that shape a user’s identity inside ListToBid.

Identity rituals ensure:

- emotional grounding  
- narrative continuity  
- lineage anchoring  
- trust formation  
- belonging  

Identity is not a checkbox — it is a rite of passage.

---

🧬 2. Identity Formation Sequence

Identity is formed through four rituals:

1. The Naming  
2. The Reflection  
3. The Binding  
4. The First Trace

Each ritual is both symbolic and functional.

---

✨ 3. Ritual One — The Naming

The user chooses:

- display name  
- avatar  
- preferred language  
- region  

This generates:

- UserXID  
- identity lineage seed  
- trust ledger seed  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your name becomes your first mark upon the Codex.
`

---

🪞 4. Ritual Two — The Reflection

The user is shown a short, poetic affirmation:

`
Every choice you make here becomes part of your story.
Every action leaves a trace.
Every trace becomes lineage.
`

This ritual introduces:

- responsibility  
- transparency  
- continuity  

It prepares the user for the living economy.

---

🔗 5. Ritual Three — The Binding

This is where the user is bound to the Codex.

The system generates:

- UserXID  
- ReferralXID (if steward path chosen)  
- MerchantXID (if seller path chosen)  
- BazarXID (if storefront created)  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your identity is now woven into the Codex.
Your lineage begins here.
`

This is the moment the user becomes part of the world.

---

🌀 6. Ritual Four — The First Trace

The user performs their first meaningful action:

- saving a listing  
- following a storefront  
- creating a listing  
- sharing a referral link  
- placing a bid  
- completing a purchase  

This generates their first lineage entry.

Ceremonial message:

`
Your first trace has been made.
The Codex remembers.
`

This is the moment identity becomes alive.

---

🧿 7. Identity Lineage Entry

`
{
  "user_xid": "<UserXID>",
  "created_at": "<ISO>",
  "language": "<EN | ES | TL>",
  "region": "<Region>",
  "first_trace": "<LineageXID>",
  "paths": {
    "buyer": <true|false>,
    "seller": <true|false>,
    "steward": <true|false>
  },
  "trust_seed": "<TLXID>",
  "referral_seed": "<ReferralXID>",
  "merchant_seed": "<MerchantXID>"
}
`

Identity is not static — it is a living lineage object.

---

🧭 8. Identity Path Rituals

Depending on the user’s chosen path:

✅ Buyer Ritual
`
You are a seeker of treasure.
Your journey begins in the Bazar.
`

✅ Seller Ritual
`
You are a creator of value.
Your craft now has a home.
`

✅ Steward Ritual
`
You are a builder of networks.
Your influence shapes the economy.
`

✅ All Paths Ritual
`
You walk all paths.
Your story will be wide and deep.
`

Each ritual activates different codices.

🛡️ 9. Identity Protections

Identity:

- cannot be overwritten  
- cannot be erased  
- cannot be transferred  
- cannot be duplicated  

Identity is permanent lineage.

---

🧩 10. Integration With Other Codices

Identity Rituals connect to:

- Onboarding Flow Codex  
- Steward’s Seal  
- Portal Messaging Layer  
- Referral Constellation Codex  
- Bazar Codex  
- Auction Codex  
- Trust Ledger Codex  

Identity is the root of the Codex.

---

🪶 11. Stewardship Notes

- Identity must feel earned, not assigned.  
- Rituals must feel warm, not dramatic.  
- The user must feel welcomed, not processed.  
- Identity must feel like a beginning, not a formality.
