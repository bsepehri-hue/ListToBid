🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the complete process of creating a listing inside the Bazar, ensuring:

- clarity  
- consistency  
- trust  
- lineage anchoring  
- marketplace health  
- emotional resonance  

A listing is not just an item — it is an offering.

---

🧬 2. Listing Identity (LST‑XID)

Every listing receives a unique ListingXID:

`
LST‑<XID>
`

This identity links to:

- MerchantXID  
- BazarXID  
- AuctionXID (if applicable)  
- SaleXIDs  
- Cycle Chain  
- Listing Performance Codex  
- Storefront Health Codex  
- Trust Ledger  

A listing is a lineage node.

🧩 3. Listing Creation Ritual

The creation of a listing follows four ceremonial steps:

1. The Offering  
2. The Description  
3. The Truth  
4. The Anchor

Each step is both functional and symbolic.

---

✨ 4. Step One — The Offering

The merchant selects:

- item category  
- item type  
- condition  
- price or auction mode  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your craft enters the world through intention.
`

This is the moment the item becomes part of the Bazar.

---

📝 5. Step Two — The Description

The merchant provides:

- title  
- detailed description  
- specifications  
- variations (if any)  
- shipping details  
- return policy  

Rules:

- must be accurate  
- must be honest  
- must reflect true condition  
- must avoid exaggeration  

Ceremonial message:

`
Clarity honors both buyer and seller.
`

---

📸 6. Step Three — The Truth

The merchant uploads images.

Rules:

- must be real photos  
- must show flaws  
- must show scale  
- must show packaging (if relevant)  
- must not use stock images unless item is new  

Ceremonial message:

`
Truth builds trust. Trust builds lineage.
`

---

🔗 7. Step Four — The Anchor

The system generates:

- ListingXID  
- listing lineage entry  
- storefront health seed update  
- performance codex seed  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your offering is now anchored in the Codex.
`

This is the moment the listing becomes alive.
