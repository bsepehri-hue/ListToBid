🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define how listings remain:

- fresh  
- accurate  
- trustworthy  
- visible  
- healthy  

This codex ensures the Bazar feels alive, not abandoned.

---

🧬 2. The Freshness Principle

A listing is considered fresh when:

- its information is accurate  
- its images reflect current condition  
- its availability is correct  
- its pricing is relevant  
- its activity is recent  

Freshness is a signal of trust.

---

🧩 3. Freshness Score (FSCORE)

Every listing receives a Freshness Score from 0–100.

It is calculated from:

- last update timestamp  
- listing activity (views, saves, bids)  
- merchant responsiveness  
- price relevance  
- image recency  
- stock accuracy  

Formula (conceptual):

`
Freshness = Activity + Accuracy + Recency + Responsiveness + Relevance
`

This score feeds:

- Listing Performance Codex  
- Storefront Health Codex  
- Platform Health Codex

🔄 4. Freshness Decay

Freshness naturally decays over time.

✅ Decay Triggers
- no updates  
- no activity  
- outdated images  
- stale pricing  
- repeated cancellations  

✅ Decay Intervals
- 7 days: minor decay  
- 14 days: moderate decay  
- 30 days: major decay  
- 60 days: listing enters “stale” state  

Decay is reversible through updates.

✨ 5. Listing Renewal Ritual

A merchant may renew a listing through:

✅ 5.1 Content Update
- new description  
- updated specs  
- corrected details  

✅ 5.2 Image Update
- new photos  
- updated condition shots  

✅ 5.3 Price Update
- price adjustment  
- discount  
- promotion  

✅ 5.4 Availability Update
- stock changes  
- variations added  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your offering has been renewed. The Bazar takes notice.
`

Renewal boosts Freshness Score.

🧿 6. Listing Update Lineage Entry

Every update generates a ListingUpdateXID:

`
{
  "update_xid": "<UpdateXID>",
  "listing": "<ListingXID>",
  "merchant": "<MerchantXID>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "type": "<content | image | price | availability>",
  "details": {...},
  "freshness_delta": <int>
}
`

Updates are lineage‑anchored.

---

⚠️ 7. Stale Listing Protocol

A listing becomes stale when:

- no updates for 60+ days  
- no activity for 45+ days  
- repeated cancellations  
- outdated information  

Stale listings:

- lose visibility  
- reduce storefront health  
- trigger Discrepancy Engine alerts (low severity)  

The merchant receives:

`
Your listing is losing vitality. Consider renewing it.
`

---

🏁 8. Auto‑Archive Protocol

A listing is auto‑archived when:

- 120+ days without updates  
- 90+ days without activity  
- merchant inactivity  
- repeated trust violations  

Auto‑archive message:

`
This offering has completed its cycle and returned to the archive.
`

Archived listings can be revived through renewal.

- Listing Performance Codex  
- Storefront Health Codex
