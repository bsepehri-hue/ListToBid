Unity • Continuity • Ecosystem

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define how all marketplace components work together as a single, unified system:

- buyers  
- merchants  
- stewards  
- storefronts  
- listings  
- auctions  
- cycles  
- trust  
- lineage  
- performance  

Cohesion ensures the marketplace feels alive, interconnected, and meaningful.

---

🧬 2. The Cohesion Principle

The marketplace is cohesive when:

- every action has a consequence  
- every cycle feeds another  
- every identity is honored  
- every listing has lineage  
- every storefront has presence  
- every steward has influence  
- every buyer has a journey  
- every sale has a story  

Cohesion is the interdependence of all systems.

🔗 3. The Marketplace Web

The marketplace is structured as a web of relationships, not a hierarchy.

`
Buyer Journey  ───────┐
                      │
Merchant Journey ─────┼── Marketplace Cohesion
                      │
Steward Journey ──────┘
`

Each journey feeds:

- cycles  
- trust  
- lineage  
- performance  
- health  

The web is bidirectional — every role affects every other.
