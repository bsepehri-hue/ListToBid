✅ Onboarding Flow Codex

This scroll defines how a new user enters the world of ListToBid — not just technically, but emotionally, narratively, and structurally.  
It’s the bridge between the Portal Messaging Layer and the living economy.

Here it is — clean, elegant, and Codex‑ready.

Orientation • Identity • First Steps

---

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the complete onboarding experience for new users entering ListToBid, ensuring:

- clarity  
- emotional resonance  
- identity formation  
- smooth activation  
- lineage initialization  

Onboarding is not a form — it is a ritual of entry.

---

🧭 2. Onboarding Structure

The onboarding flow consists of:

1. Portal Entry  
2. Identity Initialization  
3. Purpose Selection  
4. X‑ID Assignment  
5. First Orientation  
6. Path Activation  

Each step is ceremonial and functional.

---

🌅 3. Step 1 — Portal Entry

The user is greeted with:

`
Where joy becomes treasure.
`

Followed by:

`
Step into a marketplace shaped by people, not algorithms.
`

This sets the emotional tone.

---

🪞 4. Step 2 — Identity Initialization

The user chooses:

- name  
- avatar  
- preferred language (English, Spanish; Tagalog later)  
- region  

This initializes:

- UserXID  
- identity lineage  
- trust ledger seed  

Identity is the first anchor.

---

🎯 5. Step 3 — Purpose Selection

The user chooses their path:

✅ Buyer Path
“I want to explore and discover.”

✅ Seller Path
“I want to open a storefront.”

✅ Steward Path
“I want to earn by sharing.”

✅ All Paths
“I want to do everything.”

This determines which codices activate first.

---

🔗 6. Step 4 — X‑ID Assignment

The system generates:

- UserXID  
- ReferralXID (if steward path chosen)  
- MerchantXID (if seller path chosen)  
- BazarXID (if storefront created)  

This is the moment the user becomes part of the Codex.

---

🧿 7. Step 5 — First Orientation

A short, elegant orientation:

`
Every action you take here becomes part of your lineage.
Your story is now woven into the Codex.
`

Then the user sees:

- how listings work  
- how auctions work  
- how referrals work  
- how earnings work  
- how trust works  

This is the “map of the world” moment.

---

🚪 8. Step 6 — Path Activation

Depending on the chosen path:

✅ Buyer Activation
- explore listings  
- follow storefronts  
- save items  
- bid or buy  

✅ Seller Activation
- create first listing  
- set shipping rules  
- open storefront  
- publish first item  

✅ Steward Activation
- receive Steward Referral Link  
- receive Steward’s Seal (after first referral)  
- view referral constellation  

✅ All Paths Activation
Everything unlocks at once.

🧬 9. Lineage Integration

Onboarding connects to:

- Portal Messaging Layer  
- Steward’s Seal  
- Bazar Codex  
- Auction Codex  
- Referral Constellation Codex  
- Trust Ledger Codex  

Onboarding is the birth of lineage.

🪶 10. Stewardship Notes

- Onboarding must feel warm, not corporate.  
- It must feel like entering a world, not signing up for a service.  
- Every step must reinforce identity and purpose.  
- The user must feel seen, not processed.
