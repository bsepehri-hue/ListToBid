💠 2. The Platform Earnings Principle

Platform earnings must be:

- transparent  
- predictable  
- sustainable  
- ethically aligned  
- lineage‑anchored  

The platform must never feel extractive.  
It must feel like a guardian of the marketplace, not a tax collector.

---

🧮 3. Platform Earnings Structure

From the 14% total fee:

- 3% → Credit card processor  
- 2% → Steward residual (if applicable)  
- 9% → Platform earnings  

This 9% is the platform’s lifeblood.

It funds:

- infrastructure  
- support  
- treasury reserves  
- growth initiatives  
- marketplace protection  
- dispute resolution  
- fraud prevention  
- engineering  
- design  
- stewardship programs  

The platform earns only when merchants succeed.

🧾 4. Platform Earnings Lineage Entry

Every sale generates a platform earnings lineage object:

`
{
  "platformearningsxid": "<PlatformEarningsXID>",
  "sale": "<SaleXID>",
  "gross_sale": <decimal>,
  "platformfee": 0.09 * grosssale,
  "allocation": {
    "treasury_reserve": <decimal>,
    "infrastructure": <decimal>,
    "support": <decimal>,
    "growth_fund": <decimal>,
    "protection_fund": <decimal>
  },
  "timestamp": "<ISO>"
}
`

Platform earnings are traceable, not abstract.
