The Control Room of the Living Economy

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To provide administrators with a unified, real‑time view of platform health by pulling lineage‑anchored data from:

- Referral Constellation Codex  
- Storefront Health Codex  
- Listing Performance Codex  
- Merchant Performance Codex  
- Steward Performance Codex  
- Platform Health Codex  

This dashboard is the operational heartbeat of ListToBid.

🔗 4. Lineage Integration

Every metric in the dashboard is backed by:

- lineage entries  
- immutable cycle logs  
- codex rules  
- Vault panels  

Nothing is “just a number.”  
Everything is traceable.

🧿 5. Adminflow Controls

The dashboard includes:

- filters (date, category, region, storefront type)  
- alerts (trust, discrepancies, cycle failures)  
- drill‑downs  
- lineage maps  
- export to Vault view  
- steward/merchant profile access  

This is the operational cockpit of ListToBid.

🪶 6. Stewardship Notes

- Adminflow must never override lineage.  
- All performance data must be immutable except through valid events.  
- Transparency is mandatory.  
- The dashboard is a reflection of the living economy, not a replacement for it.
