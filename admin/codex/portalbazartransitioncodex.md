✅ Portal → Bazar Transition Codex
File: portalbazartransitioncodex.md_  
Threshold • Orientation • Entry

---

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the emotional and structural transition between:

- The Portal  
  (identity, intention, onboarding, clarity)

and

- The Bazar  
  (commerce, discovery, competition, presence)

This transition is the gateway ritual of ListToBid.

It must feel:

- intentional  
- welcoming  
- orienting  
- meaningful  
- alive  

The user must feel like they are entering a world, not loading a page.

---

🌉 2. The Threshold Principle

The transition must:

- acknowledge the user’s identity  
- orient them to the Bazar  
- set emotional tone  
- establish context  
- invite exploration  
- reinforce trust  

The threshold is a moment of transformation.

🧬 3. The Three Layers of Transition

The transition is composed of three layers:

1. Identity Recognition  
2. Orientation Moment  
3. Bazar Reveal

Each layer has its own tone and purpose.

---

✅ 4. Layer One — Identity Recognition
The Portal acknowledges who is entering.

Triggered when:

- user completes onboarding  
- user logs in  
- user returns to the platform  

Tone:

`
You are known. You are welcomed.
`

Examples:

- “Welcome back, Steward.”  
- “Your craft awaits.”  
- “Your journey continues.”  

Identity Recognition is the anchoring ritual.

---

✅ 5. Layer Two — Orientation Moment
The user is given a sense of direction.

Triggered when:

- user prepares to enter the Bazar  

Tone:

`
Clarity before exploration.
`

Orientation may include:

- what’s new  
- what’s trending  
- what’s relevant  
- what’s recommended  
- what’s active  

Orientation is the context ritual.

---

✅ 6. Layer Three — Bazar Reveal
The world opens.

Triggered when:

- user crosses the threshold  

Tone:

`
The Bazar awakens.
`

The reveal must feel:

- vibrant  
- alive  
- dynamic  
- welcoming  

The Bazar Reveal is the entry ritual.

🧿 7. Transition Lineage Entry

`
{
  "transition_xid": "<TransitionXID>",
  "user": "<UserXID>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "identity_state": "<new | returning | steward>",
  "orientation_context": {
    "fresh_listings": <int>,
    "active_auctions": <int>,
    "recommended": <int>
  },
  "bazarentrystate": "<entered>"
}
`

The transition is a lineage object.

🎨 8. Emotional Tone of the Transition

The transition must feel:

- ceremonial (but light)  
- intentional  
- welcoming  
- empowering  
- alive  

It must never feel:

- abrupt  
- mechanical  
- transactional  

The Portal is the inner chamber.  
The Bazar is the outer world.  
The transition is the bridge.

🪶 10. Stewardship Notes

- The transition must feel like entering a world, not switching screens.  
- Identity must be acknowledged without being intrusive.  
- Orientation must be helpful, not overwhelming.  
- The reveal must feel alive, not noisy.  
- The threshold must feel like a moment, not a loading state.
