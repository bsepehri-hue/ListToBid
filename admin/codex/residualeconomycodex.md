🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the residual income architecture of ListToBid:

- how the 2% steward residual is earned  
- how it is tracked  
- how it flows through lineage  
- how it compounds over time  
- how it strengthens the marketplace  
- how it creates a living, sustainable economy  

The Residual Economy is the engine of the Underdog Economy.

🌌 2. The Residual Principle

Residuals must be:

- simple  
- traceable  
- fair  
- lineage‑anchored  
- sustainable  

Every steward earns 2% of every sale made by any merchant they bring into the marketplace.

Forever.

This is not a referral bonus.  
This is lineage‑based economic continuity.

---

🔗 3. Residual Identity (RS‑XID)

Every residual event receives a unique ResidualXID:

`
RS‑<XID>
`

This identity links to:

- SaleXID  
- StewardXID  
- MerchantXID  
- ListingXID  
- Earnings Lineage  
- Trust Ledger (if needed)  

Residuals are lineage objects, not transactions.

---

🧬 4. Residual Flow Structure

Residuals flow through a simple, elegant structure:

`
Sale → Fee Codex → Residual Engine → Steward Earnings
`

The 2% is:

- automatically calculated  
- automatically allocated  
- automatically lineage‑anchored  

No manual intervention.  
No ambiguity.  
No complexity.

---

💠 5. Residual Calculation

Residual = 2% of gross sale price

Example:

- Sale: $100  
- Residual: $2  
- Merchant receives net after fees  
- Platform receives its 9%  
- Processor receives 3%  

Residuals are never taken from the merchant.  
They are part of the platform’s 14% fee structure.

This is what makes the system fair and sustainable.

📜 6. Residual Lineage Entry

`
{
  "residual_xid": "<ResidualXID>",
  "sale": "<SaleXID>",
  "steward": "<StewardXID>",
  "merchant": "<MerchantXID>",
  "listing": "<ListingXID>",
  "gross_sale": <decimal>,
  "residualamount": 0.02 * grosssale,
  "timestamp": "<ISO>",
  "status": "<earned | pending | released>"
}
`

Residuals are permanent lineage entries.

---

🌱 7. Steward Residual Growth

Residual income grows through:

- onboarding new merchants  
- supporting merchant success  
- encouraging listing freshness  
- promoting storefront growth  
- maintaining trust and influence  

Residuals are earned through stewardship, not exploitation.

---

🧩 8. Residual Economy Components

The Residual Economy consists of:

1. Residual Engine  
2. Steward Lineage  
3. Merchant Lineage  
4. Sale Lineage  
5. Earnings Lineage  
6. Trust Ledger  

All six components interlock to create a living economic ecosystem.

Each threat triggers:

- Steward Penalties  
- Residual Suspension (rare)

The Residual Economy connects to:

- Fee Codex  
- Steward’s Seal  
- Referral Constellation Codex  
- Earnings Lineage Codex

🪶 12. Stewardship Notes

- Residuals must feel earned, not gamed.  
- Merchants must feel supported, not exploited.  
- The economy must feel sustainable, not extractive.  
- Lineage must feel permanent, not fragile.  

The Residual Economy is the heartbeat of the Underdog Economy.
