🌌 2. The Steward Principle

Stewards earn through:

- influence  
- trust  
- support  
- guidance  
- merchant onboarding  
- ecosystem contribution  

Steward earnings must feel:

- earned, not gamed  
- fair, not extractive  
- transparent, not mysterious  
- permanent, not temporary  

Stewards are the architects of the Underdog Economy.

🔗 3. Steward Earnings Identity (SE‑XID)

SE‑<XID>
`

This identity links to:

- ResidualXID  
- SaleXID  
- MerchantXID  
- ListingXID  
- Earnings Lineage

Steward earnings are lineage‑anchored, not ephemeral.

🧮 4. Earnings Structure

Stewards earn:

- 2% of every sale made by any merchant they bring into the marketplace  
- forever  
- automatically  
- without friction  

This is not a referral bonus.  
This is lineage‑based economic continuity.
