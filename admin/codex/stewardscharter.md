🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define the identity, responsibilities, rights, and legacy of every Steward in ListToBid:

- who they are  
- what they represent  
- how they earn  
- how they influence  
- how they protect the marketplace  
- how they uphold the Codex  

The Steward’s Charter is the ethical and ceremonial contract between the platform and its stewards.

🌿 2. The Steward Identity

A Steward is:

- a guide  
- a protector  
- a connector  
- a mentor  
- a builder  
- a lineage‑bearer  

Stewards are not affiliates.  
They are architects of trust.

🔥 3. The Steward’s Vow (Ceremonial Text)

`
I serve as a steward of this marketplace,
guiding merchants with clarity,
supporting buyers with honesty,
and upholding the truth of every offering.

I honor the lineage entrusted to me,
earning not through extraction,
but through contribution, influence, and care.

I protect the underdog,
elevate the overlooked,
and strengthen the fabric of this economy.

I act with integrity,
lead with empathy,
and build with intention.

This is my charter.
This is my role.
This is my legacy.
