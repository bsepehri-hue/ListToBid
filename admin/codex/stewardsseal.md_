Identity • Influence • Legacy

🏛️ 1. Purpose

The Steward’s Seal is the identity anchor for every steward on ListToBid.  
It defines:

- who they are  
- what they represent  
- how their influence is recognized  
- how their lineage is preserved  
- how their legacy is carried forward  

The Seal is both symbolic and functional — a mark of trust and a binding to lineage.

🔗 2. Seal Identity (STW‑SEAL)

Each steward receives a unique Steward Seal ID:

`
STW‑SEAL‑<XID>
`

This Seal links to:

- STW‑XID (identity)  
- Referral lineage  
- Residual lineage  
- Trust ledger  
- Performance codex  
- Storefront (if applicable)  

The Seal is the steward’s permanent signature inside the Vault.

🧩 3. Components of the Seal

The Steward’s Seal contains five symbolic elements:

✅ 3.1 The Circle (Continuity)
Represents the ongoing cycles of:

- referral  
- influence  
- earnings  
- trust  
- lineage  

A steward is part of a living loop.

---

✅ 3.2 The Line (Integrity)
A vertical line through the circle.

Represents:

- truth  
- transparency  
- accountability  

A steward stands upright in the economy.

---

✅ 3.3 The Dot (Origin)
A small dot at the center.

Represents:

- the steward’s first referral  
- the moment they entered the lineage  
- the spark that begins their legacy  

Every steward starts with a single point of influence.

---

✅ 3.4 The Arc (Growth)
A curved arc around the circle.

Represents:

- network expansion  
- residual flow  
- stewardship impact  

The arc grows as the steward grows.

---

✅ 3.5 The Mark (Recognition)
A small angled stroke.

Represents:

- the steward’s unique identity  
- their contribution  
- their presence in the Codex  

This is the steward’s signature.

🪶 5. Ritual of Sealing

A steward receives their Seal when:

1. They complete their first referral  
2. Their first Sale Cycle closes  
3. Their first residual is anchored  
4. Their trust ledger is initialized  
5. Their performance codex is created  

This moment is recorded as:

`
The Steward’s First Seal
`

It becomes part of their permanent history.

🛡️ 6. Seal Protections

The Seal:
