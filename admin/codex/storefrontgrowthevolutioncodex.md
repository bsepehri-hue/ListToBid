🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define how storefronts grow over time through:

- activity  
- consistency  
- trust  
- performance  
- lineage  
- community presence  

A storefront is not static — it is a living entity that evolves with the merchant.

---

🌱 2. The Growth Principle

A storefront grows when:

- listings are fresh  
- sales cycles complete cleanly  
- disputes are resolved fairly  
- communication is respectful  
- updates are consistent  
- customers return  
- trust is earned  

Growth is the accumulation of good cycles.

🧩 3. Storefront Growth Score (SGSCORE)

Every storefront receives a Growth Score from 0–100.

It is calculated from:

- listing freshness  
- sales volume  
- dispute rate  
- RMA behavior  
- communication responsiveness  
- shipping reliability  
- customer saves/follows  
- repeat buyers  
- update frequency  

Conceptual formula:

`
Growth = Freshness + Reliability + Trust + Activity + Continuity
`

This score feeds:

- Storefront Health Codex  
- Merchant Performance Codex  
- Platform Health Codex
