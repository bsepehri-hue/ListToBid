Presence • Personality • Expression

---

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define how storefronts express:

- personality  
- craft  
- visual identity  
- tone  
- narrative  
- presence  

A storefront is not a template — it is a character inside the Bazar.

🎨 2. Identity Components

Every storefront identity is built from six elements:

1. Name  
2. Avatar  
3. Banner  
4. Color Accent  
5. Tone of Voice  
6. Storyline  

Each element contributes to the storefront’s presence.

🧩 3. Storefront Name

The name must be:

- unique  
- memorable  
- reflective of craft  
- easy to search  
- aligned with merchant identity  

Examples of identity archetypes:

- Craft‑Driven: “Handwoven Echo”  
- Tech‑Driven: “Circuit & Signal”  
- Vintage‑Driven: “Old Harbor Finds”  
- Minimalist: “Plain & True”  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your name becomes the banner under which your craft travels.
`

🖼️ 4. Avatar

The avatar represents:

- the merchant  
- the craft  
- the tone  

Rules:

- must be clear  
- must be recognizable  
- must not mislead  
- must not impersonate brands  

The avatar is the face of the storefront.

---

🏞️ 5. Banner

The banner sets the emotional tone.

It may express:

- craft style  
- color palette  
- mood  
- seasonality  
- personality  

The banner is the atmosphere of the storefront.

---

🎨 6. Color Accent

Each storefront chooses a single accent color.

This color is used for:

- buttons  
- highlights  
- badges  
- micro‑interactions  

Rules:

- must not conflict with platform colors  
- must be accessible  
- must reinforce identity  

Examples:

- Warm craft: amber  
- Modern tech: teal  
- Vintage: burgundy  
- Minimalist: charcoal  

The accent color is the emotional signature.

---

🗣️ 7. Tone of Voice

The storefront’s tone defines how it speaks.

Archetypes:

✅ Warm & Personal
“Every piece is made with care.”

✅ Professional & Precise
“Specifications are listed below.”

✅ Playful & Light
“Found this gem — hope you love it.”

✅ Minimal & Clean
“Simple. Honest. Direct.”

Tone must be consistent across:

- descriptions  
- messages  
- policies  
- updates  

Tone is the voice of the storefront.

---

📜 8. Storyline

Every storefront has a short narrative:

- who they are  
- what they sell  
- why they sell  
- what makes them unique  

This appears in:

- storefront description  
- merchant profile  
- About section  

Ceremonial message:

`
Your story becomes part of the Bazar’s tapestry.
`

🪶 13. Stewardship Notes

- Identity must feel like a story, not a setting.
