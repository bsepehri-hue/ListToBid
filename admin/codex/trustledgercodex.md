✅ Trust Ledger Codex

Integrity • Evidence • Resolution

🏛️ 1. Purpose

To define how trust is measured, recorded, and enforced across the entire ListToBid ecosystem.  
The Trust Ledger governs:

- disputes  
- evidence  
- resolutions  
- policy compliance  
- behavioral patterns  
- penalties  
- trust events  
- lineage impact  

It is the behavioral backbone of the platform.

🔗 2. Trust Ledger Structure

Every trust event is logged as a TLXID entry inside the Vault.

`

├── Disputes
├── Evidence
├── Resolutions
├── Policy Violations
├── Behavioral Flags
└── Integrity Scores

Each entry is immutable and lineage‑anchored.

🧩 3. Trust Event Types

✅ 3.1 Dispute Events
Triggered when a buyer or merchant opens a dispute.

- Item not received  
- Item not as described  
- Damaged item  
- Wrong item  
- Fraud suspicion  

Each dispute generates a TLXID.

---

✅ 3.2 Evidence Events
Evidence submitted by either party.

- photos  
- videos  
- messages  
- tracking  
- receipts  
- timestamps  

Evidence is linked to:

- ListingXID  
- SaleXID  
- ShippingXID  
- RMAXID  

---

✅ 3.3 Resolution Events
Outcome of a dispute.

- merchant wins  
- buyer wins  
- partial credit  
- full credit  
- admin override (rare)  

Resolution updates:

- Merchant Performance  
- Steward Performance  
- Storefront Health  
- Listing Performance  

---

✅ 3.4 Policy Compliance Events
Triggered when a user violates platform rules.

- late shipping  
- repeated cancellations  
- abusive messaging  
- evidence tampering  
- false claims  
- chargeback abuse  

Each violation affects trust score.

---

✅ 3.5 Behavioral Flags
Automatic flags generated by the Discrepancy Engine.

- abnormal dispute rate  
- repeated RMA patterns  
- inconsistent evidence  
- mismatched timestamps  
- suspicious buyer behavior  
- suspicious merchant behavior  

Flags do not penalize — they trigger review.

📜 5. Trust Score Formula

A composite score derived from:

`
Trust = Evidence Quality + Resolution Outcomes + Policy Compliance + Behavioral Stability
`

Scores affect:

- Merchant Performance  
- Steward Performance  
- Storefront Health  
- Platform Health  

Trust is not a punishment system — it is a behavioral truth system.

---

⚖️ 6. Resolution Rules

- Evidence must be weighted higher than claims.  
- Repeated false claims reduce trust.  
- Repeated valid claims increase trust.  
- Admin overrides must be logged with justification.  
- All resolutions must anchor to lineage.  

---

🧬 7. Lineage Integration

The Trust Ledger connects to:

- Cycle Chain Codex  
- Storefront Health Codex  
- Merchant Performance Codex  
- Steward Performance Codex  
- Platform Health Codex  

Every trust event becomes part of the permanent lineage.

---

🪶 8. Stewardship Notes

- Trust cannot be edited after closure.  
- Evidence must be immutable.  
- Behavioral flags must be reviewed, not assumed.  
- Trust is earned through consistency, not perfection.  
- The ledger protects both buyers and merchants.
