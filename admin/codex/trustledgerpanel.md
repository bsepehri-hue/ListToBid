🔐 Trust Ledger Panel
Vault Panel • Integrity Tracking • Stewardship Record

1. Purpose
To maintain an immutable record of trust‑related events across the entire ListToBid ecosystem.  
This panel documents confirmations, disputes, resolutions, stewardship actions, and any event that affects the integrity of the marketplace.

It answers the question:  
“What actions shaped trust in this lineage?”

---

2. Placement
Third panel inside the Vault, completing the foundational triad:

1. Earnings Lineage — where the money flows  
2. Referral Constellation — where the people connect  
3. Trust Ledger — where integrity is recorded  

This triad forms the core of the Vault’s architecture.

- Charcoal background  
- Brass horizontal dividers  
- Monospace text for entries  
- Subtle amber highlights for unresolved items  
- Emerald highlights for resolved items  
- Burgundy for critical alerts  

Each entry expands into a drawer for deeper detail.
