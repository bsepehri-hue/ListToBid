✅ THE MARKETPLACE EXPERIENCE LAYER (User‑Facing Flow Codex)

This is the layer that sits between the Portal Tier and the deep Marketplace Tier.  
It defines how users actually move through the world — the flows, the transitions, the emotional beats, the logic of discovery.

This is not about listings or auctions.  
This is about the experience of being inside ListToBid.

Let’s open it cleanly.
