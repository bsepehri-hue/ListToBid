🔐 CODEX ENTRY — The Vault Glimpse Banner
Placement Ritual • Visual Lineage • Steward Threshold

1. Name
Vault Glimpse Banner

2. Purpose
A symbolic, non-interactive visual anchor representing the hidden infrastructure of ListToBid — lineage, security, multi-role earnings, and the sanctum of stewardship.  
It is not a feature. It is a threshold.

3. Placement Logic
- Positioned directly beneath the two primary cards:
  - Multi-role Earnings
  - Trust & Stewardship
- Sits between two bright picture frames, creating a visual “opening” into the belly of the system.
- Acts as the middle layer in a three-tier symbolic stack:
  1. Trust & Earnings (promise)
  2. Vault Glimpse (mystery)
  3. Merchant in Motion (purpose)

4. Visual Composition
- Narrow horizontal banner.
- Brass vault hardware photograph, darkened to 20–30% visibility.
- High contrast between:
  - Bright frames (outer world)
  - Dark vault interior (inner sanctum)
- No buttons, no labels, no calls to action.
- The viewer should feel like they’re catching a glimpse of something not meant for casual access.

5. Interaction Rules
- Homepage:  
  - Purely symbolic.  
  - No hover states, no links, no tooltips.  
  - It exists to create curiosity, not to satisfy it.

- Dashboard:  
  - The Vault becomes an actual feature.  
  - Access is contextual and role-based.  
  - The homepage glimpse becomes a rite of passage once inside.

6. Narrative Function
The Vault Glimpse Banner reinforces the core ListToBid mythology:
- Trust and earnings sit on the surface.
- The Vault is the protected engine beneath.
- The merchant is the living heartbeat below it all.

This creates a subconscious message:
“There is more here than meets the eye — and you’ll unlock it when you’re ready.”

7. Stewardship Notes
- This banner is a ceremonial artifact, not a UI component.
- It should never be repurposed for marketing, onboarding, or transactional flows.
- It anchors the idea that ListToBid has depth, lineage, and protected infrastructure.
