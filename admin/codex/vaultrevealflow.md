🔐 CODEX ENTRY — Dashboard Vault Reveal Flow
Steward Threshold • Role-Based Access • Inner Chamber

1. Name
Vault Reveal Flow (Dashboard)

2. Purpose
To transform the Vault from a symbolic glimpse on the homepage into a functional, role-gated chamber inside the dashboard.  
This is where stewards encounter the protected mechanics of ListToBid: lineage, earnings, trust cycles, and multi-role visibility.

3. Entry Conditions
The Vault is never visible to casual visitors.  
It appears only when:
- A user is authenticated  
- Their role includes Steward, Merchant, or Admin  
- Their dashboard context is active  

This preserves the sanctity of the Vault as a threshold, not a feature.

4. Reveal Sequence

4.1 Dashboard Arrival
Upon entering the dashboard:
- No popups  
- No announcements  
- No onboarding overlays  
The Vault should feel like something that has always been there, waiting.

4.2 Vault Icon / Label
Placed in the left sidebar or top utility bar:
- Minimalist icon (circle + lock or vault wheel)  
- Label: Vault  
- No subtext  
- No badges  

It should feel like a quiet door.

4.3 First-Time Entry
When a steward clicks the Vault for the first time:
- A soft fade transition  
- A brief line of text appears:

“Welcome to the inner chamber.”

No marketing.  
No explanation.  
Just acknowledgment.

4.4 Chamber Layout
Inside the Vault:
- Darker palette (teal → deep emerald → charcoal gradient)  
- Brass accents echoing the homepage glimpse  
- Clean, ledger-like structure  
- Sections such as:
  - Earnings Lineage
  - Referral Constellation
  - Trust Ledger
  - Steward Residuals
  - Platform Fees & Cycles
  - X‑ID Anchors

Each section is a panel, not a card — the Vault is not a marketplace; it is a chamber.

5. Interaction Rules
- No animations except subtle breathing glows on active panels  
- No confetti, no celebratory UI  
- Every action should feel like opening a drawer in a secure archive  
- Data is presented with clarity, not spectacle  

The Vault is where truth lives.

6. Narrative Function
The Vault Reveal Flow completes the symbolic lineage:

1. Homepage Cards  
   Trust & Earnings — the promise.

2. Vault Glimpse Banner  
   The hidden engine — the mystery.

3. Dashboard Vault  
   The chamber — the truth.

This is the architecture of ListToBid’s mythology.

7. Stewardship Notes
- Never surface the Vault in marketing pages  
- Never link to it from emails  
- Never expose it to unauthenticated users  
- The Vault is a privilege, not a feature  
- Its existence should be felt before it is understood
