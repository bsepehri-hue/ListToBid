✅ Shimmer + Fade‑In Checklist

Shimmer (Skeletons)
- [ ] Use shimmer skeletons only for async data (dashboards, charts, lists, totals).  
- [ ] Keep skeletons simple (cards, bars, circles) — no extra decoration.  
- [ ] Match skeleton layout to the final content (so the transition feels natural).  

Fade‑In
- [ ] Apply a single fade‑in (700ms opacity transition) when replacing skeletons with real content.  
- [ ] Wrap content in a reusable <FadeIn> component for consistency.  
- [ ] Use the same timing everywhere — no stagger, slide, or bounce.  

Static Areas
- [ ] Navigation, headers, footers → no shimmer, no fade‑in.  
- [ ] Static text pages (About, Terms, Help) → load instantly.  
- [ ] Buttons, menus, links → rely on hover states, not load animations.  

Consistency
- [ ] Always pair shimmer → fade‑in for async content.  
- [ ] Never mix different animation styles.  
- [ ] Keep palette and theme logic consistent with brand colors.  
- [ ] Test transitions on both light and dark mode.
