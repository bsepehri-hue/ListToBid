🖼️ Visual Proof Protocol
- Every diagram, mockup, or ceremonial image must be stored in the Admin directory.  
- Images serve as visual proof of codex entries, not decorative extras.  
- Each image is referenced in milestones.txt with date, purpose, and scroll linkage.

🎨 Mockups & Diagrams
- Wireframes and flow diagrams codify platform architecture (Marketplace, Auction, Storefront, Infrastructure, Ledger).  
- Compact layouts and checklist‑style renew flows are preferred for clarity.  
- Mockups must align with ListToBid’s brand palette:  
  - Deep Emerald Green (#046307) for buttons/headers  
  - Amber (#FFBF00) for highlights  
  - Burgundy (#800020) for alerts  
  - Black (#000000) for text  
  - Off‑White (#f8f8f5) for background canvas

📜 Ceremony of Images
- Each image is sealed with a progression text (ritual phrase) to mark its creation.  
- Images are not standalone; they are ceremonial witnesses to codex milestones.  
- Gallery scroll ensures visual unity across Adminflow, Ledger, Marketplace, and Storefront.  

---

🧬 Legacy Clause
- Gallery is the memory of sight within the codex.  
- Future stewards inherit both diagrams and their ceremonial context.  
- Images are proof of resilience, clarity, and the Underdog Economy’s living legacy.
