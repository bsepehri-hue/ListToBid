Vault Protocol
- Holds funds in escrow until sale finality or refund conditions met
- Anchors AML/KYC compliance and merchant obligations
- Connected to Marketplace for payout triggers and refund verification
- Does not issue refunds from platform funds; merchant-fMilestone.

Token Utility Logic
- Used for referral payouts, steward incentives, loyalty credits
- Not a payment instrument; does not govern listings or storefronts
- Distributed via Infrastructure Services based on codex triggers
- Token contract is modular and upgradable without disrupting Marketplace

AML/KYC Compliance
- Vault enforces AML rules under Bank Secrecy Act
- Transactions ≥ $10,000 reported via IRS Form 8300
- Transactions ≥ $9,000 flagged for review to prevent structuring
- Merchants must complete KYC/KYB before storefront activation
- Token transactions subject to same compliance standards

Smart Contract Manifesto
- The Underdog Economy Manifesto embedded in Vault and Token contracts
- Ensures transparency, immutability, and legacy on-chain
- Visible to all future stewards as part of platform DNA
