📂 marketplace.txt — Draft Codex Entry

🏛 Marketplace Protocol
- Marketplace is the anchor contract unifying Auctions, Storefronts, and Infrastructure.  
- Serves as the single point of interaction for stewards, merchants, and customers.  
- Vault and Token remain supporting modules, connected through Infrastructure Services.  
- Marketplace enforces codex principles: clarity, inclusivity, merchant autonomy, and resilience.
