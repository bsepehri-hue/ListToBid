- Stewards can initiate ceremony to activate new storefronts and seal codex entries.  
- Residual income (2%) and referral commissions (2%) tracked via ledger integration.  

---

🛡️ Reviewer Dashboard
- Reviewers moderate auctions, resolve disputes, and enforce codex compliance.  
- Act‑ID lifecycle visible for every auction, with ledger flags for disputes.  
- Reviewer actions are logged and auditable; no silent moderation allowed.  
- Vault integration ensures compliance before releasing escrowed funds.
